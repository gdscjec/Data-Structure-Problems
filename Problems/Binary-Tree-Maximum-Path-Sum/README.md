## Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum

A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

_Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the maximum **path sum of any non-empty path**_.

##### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
