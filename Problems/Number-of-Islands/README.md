## Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

##### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'.`
