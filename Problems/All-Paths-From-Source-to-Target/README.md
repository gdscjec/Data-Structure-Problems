## All Paths From Source to Target

Given a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

##### Constraints:

- `n == graph.length`
- `2 <= n <= 15`
- `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
- `graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
- All the elements of `graph[i]` are **unique**.
- The input graph is **guaranteed** to be a **DAG**.
