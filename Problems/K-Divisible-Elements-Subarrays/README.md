## K Divisible Elements Subarrays

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `p`, return _the number of **distinct subarrays** which have **at most** k elements divisible by p_.

Two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are said to be **distinct** if:

- They are of **different** lengths, or
- There exists **at least** one index `i` where `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

A **subarray** is defined as a **non-empty** contiguous sequence of elements in an array.

##### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i], p <= 200`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
