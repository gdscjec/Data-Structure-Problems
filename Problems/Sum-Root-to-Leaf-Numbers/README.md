## Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

- For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.
Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

##### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
- The depth of the tree will not exceed `10`.
